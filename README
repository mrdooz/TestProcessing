Test Processing

I recently decided to check out the [processing library](http://processing.org/), and found that it was pretty much exactly what I had been looking for. So far I've resisted the urge to try to make a C# (or C++/DirectX) version.

I've been playing around, implementing some steering behavoir stuff.
